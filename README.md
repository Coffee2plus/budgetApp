# Simplify Your Finances - Budget App
A budget app project meant to simplify desktop budget views in order to plan, track, and visualize expenses.
Meant to be a direct upgrade from using a custom Google Sheets file.
Current stack: Next.js React (Typescript), Spring Boot Java.

Planned for future: MySQL DB integration, practice with deploying to a cluster using CI/CD.

Phase 1: Initial project creation, basic functionality with views created. This functionality includes adding, modifying, and deleting a budget. For the front end, there should additionally be an ability to set a budget goal, and view expenses in a calendar view.

Phase 2: Account and security development, added functionality for the ability to create graph and chart views of budget expenses, a budget planner wizard, maybe ai chat?

Phase 3: TBD.
